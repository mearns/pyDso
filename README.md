# pyDso

Dead Simple Observables, for Python.

This is a toy implementation of some of the core **Reactive Programming** concepts,
especially as described in the vry excellent
["The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing"](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754).

The purpose isn't for you to actually use this library. If you want reactive programming tools in
python, you can use something written by people who actually _grok_ reactive programming, such
as [RxPy](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY).

The purpose is to show that the basic concepts behind reactive programming are really simple.
Assuming I understand them correctly.
